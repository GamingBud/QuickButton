# QuickButton
--
With QuickButton, you can simply send a single line message to have a button created. It includes press_detection and mouse-over highlighting. A message will be sent back to your script, where you can handle the action fluidly, when the button is pressed.

If you wanted to delete the button on press, included in the message is the button number. You simply have to delete the nodes associated with that number and set that table entry to nil.
